# Personal Calendar web part

This web part provides you the ability to add a particular user's personal calendar on a web page. The web part may be configured to automatically refresh, as well as display up to seven days of events and a pre-defined number of events at a time. This web part is powered by the Microsoft Graph and currently requires that the Office 365 tenant be configured for targeted release for all users.

> `NOTE:` This webpart includes the use of a custom SPFx library, [library-starter-kit-shared](../library-starter-kit-shared). If you need to rebuild / bundle / package this solution, refer to [Minimal Path to Awesome](#Minimal-Path-to-Awesome)

## Used SharePoint Framework Version

![drop](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.9.1-green.svg)

* Only supported in SharePoint Online due to dependency on the Microsoft Graph APIs

## Applies to

* [SharePoint Framework](https:/dev.office.com/sharepoint)
* [Office 365 tenant](https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)


## Prerequisites

* [library-starter-kit-shared](../library-starter-kit-shared) - this is provided by default in the solution. If you need to rebuild / bundle / package this solution, refer to [Minimal Path to Awesome](#Minimal-Path-to-Awesome)


## Minimal Path to Awesome

This solution uses a SPFx library, [library-starter-kit-shared](../library-starter-kit-shared). As such, additional steps are required to rebuild this project.

1. Clone this entire project
2. Within the [library-starter-kit-shared](../library-starter-kit-shared) source, i.e. [./source/library-starter-kit-shared](../library-starter-kit-shared)
  
  ```powershell
  npm install
  gulp build
  gulp bundle
  npm link
  ```

3. Within this SPFx solution folder [react-personal-calendar](./), i.e. [./source/react-personal-calendar](../react-personal-calendar)
  * in the command line run:
  
  ```powershell
  npm install
  npm link @starter-kit/shared-library
  ```

4. Edit package.json found at the root of the [react-personal-calendar](./), i.e. [./source/react-personal-calendar/package.json](../react-personal-calendar/package.json)

  - Add a new dependancy to the project: "@starter-kit/shared-library": "1.0.0"

  **Example**:

  ```xml
    "dependencies": {
      "@microsoft/mgt-react": "^2.0.0-preview.5",
      ...
      "react": "16.8.5",
      "react-dom": "16.8.5"
    }
  ```

  to:

  ```xml
    "dependencies": {
      "@microsoft/mgt-react": "^2.0.0-preview.5",
      ...
      "react": "16.8.5",
      "react-dom": "16.8.5",
      "@starter-kit/shared-library": "1.0.0"
    }
  ```

5. Within this SPFx solution folder [react-personal-calendar](./), i.e. [./source/react-personal-calendar](../react-personal-calendar)
  
  * in the command line run:
  
  ```powershell
  gulp serve
  ```

6. To rebundle the webpart, within this SPFx solution folder [react-personal-calendar](./), i.e. [./source/react-personal-calendar](../react-personal-calendar)
  * in the command line run:
  
  ```powershell
  gulp bundle
  gulp package-solution
  ```

> If you add this webpart's sppkg to your app catalog, the sppkg for the [shared library](../library-starter-kit-shared) must also be installed. The [library](../library-starter-kit-shared) may be built, bundled, and packaged similar to a standard SPFx webpart or extension.

> The package.json within this SPFx solution file must be manually updated for if the library dependency was included by default with the project, **npm install** would fail as the [library-starter-kit-shared](../library-starter-kit-shared) package would not be found. Linking the two projects allows this webpart to reference the library during **development**, while the package.json reference is required for **bundling and packaging**.


## Features

Description of the web part with possible additional details than in short summary. 
This Web Part illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

* Using Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft Graph Toolkit React components within a web part
* Using [SharePoint Framework library components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/library-component-overview_)
* Hosting SharePoint Framework components as Microsoft Teams tabs
* Using app pages in SharePoint Online
